Dear Amazon,

I am the [author](https://dergigi.com/contact) of [21
Lessons](https://21lessons.com/), a book published under a
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. The
[English version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1697526349/) of the book was
approved by you and is available on Amazon. The [Kindle
version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083L93MJ7) was approved by you as well and
is available on Amazon as well.

The book was [translated into multiple
languages](https://21lessons.com/translations) by volunteers under the same
cc-by-sa license. The [German book](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B085KR54YT/) "21
Lektionen" - which was also approved by you and is available on Amazon - is
based on the two German translations which I reviewed, corrected, and modified.

Niko Laamanen did the Dutch translation and he would like to publish it via
Amazon as well. This is explicitly allowed by the license, so he doesn't
even need my permission, which he has anyway.

Again, just for you guys: I hereby grant Konsensus Network all necessary rights
to publish 21 Lessons in other languages, such as Dutch and Finnish, as defined
in  the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)
license.

As I've mentioned above, this is explicitly allowed by the CC BY-SA 4.0 license
I used. Everyone is free to remix my content and also sell it under this
copyleft license.

Sincerely, \\
[Gigi](https://dergigi.com/contact)
